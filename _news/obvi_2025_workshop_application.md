#### Ocean Biogeochemical Perspectives and Emerging Topics: Primary Production

A 2-week workshop for OBVI graduate students and post-docs. Funding for this project is provided by the [Schmidt Sciences Ocean Biogeochemistry Virtual Institute](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/the-ocean-biogeochemistry-virtual-institute-obvi/) to the Subtropical Underwater Biogeochemistry and Subsurface Export Alliance (SUBSEA) program.

Workshop dates: November 30 - December 12, 2025
- Location: University of Hawaii at Manoa
- Application deadline: April 15, 2025
- [Application Link](https://forms.gle/HiTw8S9vEasGYbK39)

Workshop will include daily lectures, hands-on analyses and modeling of ocean productivity data, and training in ocean biogeochemical sampling and methodologies. Workshop objectives include:

1. Gain familiarity with concepts, definitions, and methods used to estimate primary production, particles distributions, and phytoplankton biomass
2. Become familiar with publicly available data and data products specific to ocean primary production
3. Analyze shipboard, autonomous, and remote sensing data and data products
