### **Calvin Swart** PhD candidate
##### University of Cape Town, South Africa

Calvin Swart is pursuing a Ph.D. at University of Cape Town, South Africa. With SUBSEA, she is investigating nitrogen cycling in subtropical systems. Using nitrate isotopes (δ¹⁵N, δ¹⁸O), the δ¹⁵N of phytoplankton biomass, and the δ¹⁵N of total dissolved nitrogen, her work identifies the sources, transformations, and export pathways of nitrogen in oligotrophic systems where primary productivity is often nitrogen-limited.
