### **Deepika Sahoo** postdoc
#### University of Montana, USA

Deepika is a biogeochemist and microbial ecologist studying compositional and physiological changes in marine microbes with varying environmental forcings. She has joined the Flathead Lake Biological Station (FLBS) as a postdoctoral associate under the supervision of Prof. Robert O. Hall and Prof. Matthew Church. With SUBSEA, she is investigating how environmental forcings such as nutrient limitations and warming influence the physiological responses of microbes and, subsequently, the ocean’s carbon uptake efficiency. Prior to FLBS, Deepika investigated the physiological transformations in microbial stoichiometric traits using an energy dispersive technique at Colorado State University, Fort Collins. She obtained her Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, one of the premier institutes in India, where she studied the C:N:P stoichiometry in the organic and inorganic pools of the northern Indian Ocean. Deepika earned her bachelor’s degree from the North Orissa University and master’s degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur in Geology in India.
