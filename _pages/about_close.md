Dr. Hilary Close is an Associate Professor at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science at the University of Miami. Her lab uses field sampling and laboratory techniques to develop and apply organic and natural isotopic indicators for identifying the sources and degradative pathways of organic matter in marine water columns. Her recent work has advanced the application of compound-specific isotopic analysis to study marine particulate matter in the context of microbial communities, food webs, and the biological pump. Dr. Close’s educational background focused on natural-abundance isotope biogeochemistry (Ph.D., Harvard University) and geology (B.A., Oberlin College), and her experience in seagoing chemical oceanography and marine food webs was developed during her time as a NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellow and SOEST Young Investigator at the University of Hawai῾i.
