Daniela del Valle, Ph.D. in Marine Science, is a Research Scientist at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), based at the National Institute for Fisheries Research and Development (INIDEP) in Argentina. Her expertise is in marine biogeochemistry, particularly the production and consumption of dissolved gases in the ocean’s surface layer, where she has applied radiotracer and stable isotope techniques to quantify microbial processes. Within SUBSEA, she serves as a co-PI, focusing on primary productivity dynamics through O₂/Ar ratio measurements and ¹⁸O–H₂O tracer experiments. Her current research advances understanding of microbial contributions to carbon cycling and their responses to environmental variability. She is also active in regional and global ocean observation initiatives, promoting collaborative research and data integration to address knowledge gaps in undersampled regions.
